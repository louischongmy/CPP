Our aim in writing the original edition of Numerical Recipes was to provide a
book that combined general discussion, analytical mathematics, algorithmics,
and actual working programs. The success of the first edition puts us now in a
difficult, though hardly unenviable, position. We wanted, then and now, to write
a book that is informal, fearlessly editorial, unesoteric, and above all useful.
There is a danger that, if we are not careful, we might produce a second edition
that is weighty, balanced, scholarly, and boring. Also used were a variety of
C compilers, too numerous (and sometimes too buggy) for individual acknowledgment.
It is a sobering fact that our standard test suite (exercising all the
routines in this book) has uncovered compiler bugs in many of the compilers
tried. When possible, we work with developers to see that such bugs get fixed; we
encourage interested compiler developers to contact us about such arrangements.
